# COVID-Impact-Analysis
This project involves analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 10 selected companies' stocks. It includes data transformation, frequent item-set mining, association rule generation, classification, principal component analysis, and clustering analysis to understand market trends and company behaviour during the pandemic.

Stock Classification Analysis
- Dimensionality reduction
- Normalization
- Aggregation
- PCA (principal component analysis)
- Classification

PCA (principal component analysis): we reduced stock market features (such as Open price, Close price, Adjusted Close price, and Volume of shares traded) into two components to show the effects of those features on the direction of the stock.

Classification: categorizing stock market records using a Decision Tree Classifier, which predicts whether a stock will increase or decrease in price.

Stock Cluster Analysis
- Data transformation
- Association rule mining, Frequent item-sets, Measures of interest
- Preprocessing, k-means clustering

Association rule mining: discovered correlations in the stock price and directionality between pairs of companies, possibly indicating similar market positions, industries, and company actions.

k-means clustering: uses python ML library to cluster records together based on their stock price and directionality to reveal correlations.
